## Requirements

The setups steps expect following tools installed on the system.

- Ruby        => [3.3.6](javascript:void(0);)
- Rails       => [8.x](javascript:void(0);)
- PostgreSQL  => [14.x](javascript:void(0);) or MySQL => [9.x](javascript:void(0);)
- Redis       => [7.x](javascript:void(0);)

## Getting Started

It's super easy to get Sanda up and running.

First clone the project and change the directory

```shell
git clone https://github.com/hmtanbir/sanda.git
cd sanda
```

Then follow the process using either Docker or without Docker (simple).

### Without Docker (Simple)

## Install the dependencies

1. Install project gems

```shell
bundle config set path 'vendor' && bundle install
```

2. Prepare .env file

Copy .env.example file and paste as .env
```shell
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Generate application secret key and update .env file's `SECRET_KEY` value.

```shell
bundle exec rails secret
```

## Start the webserver

You can run server following command:

```shell
bundle exec rails server -p 3000 -b 0.0.0.0
```

That's mostly it! You have a fully running Ruby on Rails installation, all configured.

## Using Docker
If you want to use docker container, then you have to follow some steps following below:

### Build docker container

Build your docker container following command:

```shell
docker compose build --no-cache
```

### Run docker container

Now, We will run the container following command:

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

### Stop docker container

Now, We will run the container following command:

```shell
docker compose down
```

### Remove docker container
If you want remove container with it's volumes following the command:

```shell
docker compose down --volumes --remove-orphans
```


## List of Default Routes

Here is a list of default routes. Run the following rails command to see this list in your terminal.

```shell
bundle exec rails routes
```

## Default Roles

Sanda comes with these `admin` & `user` roles out of the box. For details, If you want to add more role, open `config/roles.yml` file.


## Routes Documentation

Let's have a look at what Sanda has to offer. Before experimenting with the following API endpoints, run your Sanda project using `rails server -p 3000 -b 0.0.0.0` command. For the next part of this documentation, we assumed that Sanda is listening at http://localhost:3000

### User Registration

You can make an `HTTP POST` call to create/register a new user to the following endpoint. Newly created users will have the `user` role by default.

```shell
http://localhost:3000/api/v1/registration
```

**API Payload & Response**

You can send a Form Multipart payload or a JSON payload like this.

```json
{
  "user": {
    "name": "Sanda User",
    "email": "user@sanda.project",
    "password": "sanda-user-123"
  }
}
```

Voila! Your user has been created and is now ready to log in!

If this user already exists, then you will receive a 422 Response like this

```json
{
  "status": 422,
  "message": [
    "Email has already been taken"
  ],
  "data": null
}
```

### User Authentication/Login (Admin)

Remember Sanda comes with the default admin user? You can log in as an admin by making an HTTP POST call to the following route.

```shell
http://localhost:3000/api/v1/sessions
```

**API Payload & Response**

You can send a Form Multipart or a JSON payload like this.

```json
{
  "user": {
    "email": "admin@sanda.project",
    "password": "sanda-admin-123"
  }
}
```

You will get a JSON response with user token. You need this admin token for making any call to other routes protected by admin ability.

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "message": "Successfully data fetched",
  "data": {
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxLCJleHAiOjE3NTM3NjYzMzh9.fuaZL5O2meayrdQT0_YalMhp2hK_mOGPduyBKpsmZz0"
  }
}
```

For any unsuccessful attempt, you will receive a 401 error response.

For invalid email address:
```json
{
  "status": 404,
  "message": "invalid email",
  "data": null
}
```
For invalid password:
```json
{
    "status": 401,
    "message": "invalid password",
    "data": null
}
```

### User Authentication/Login (Other Roles)

You can log in as a user by making an HTTP POST call to the following route

```shell
http://localhost:3000/api/v1/sessions
```

**API Payload & Response**

You can send a Form Multipart or a JSON payload like this

```json
{
  "user": {
    "email": "user@sanda.project",
    "password": "sanda-user-123"
  }
}
```

You will get a JSON response with user token. You need this user token for making any calls to other routes protected by user ability.

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "message": "Successfully data fetched",
  "data": {
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjozLCJleHAiOjE3NTM3NjYzMzh9.c3Pp9pSbH0UoY01NmSa9cydqqla2Jmqt0JhnbqPte8Q"
  }
}
```

For any unsuccessful attempt, you will receive a 401 error response.

For invalid email address:
```json
{
  "status": 404,
  "message": "invalid email",
  "data": null
}
```
For invalid password:
```json
{
    "status": 401,
    "message": "invalid password",
    "data": null
}
```

### List Users (Admin Ability Required)

To list the all users, make an `HTTP GET` call to the following route, with Admin Token obtained from Admin Login. Add this token as a standard `Bearer Token` to your API call.

```shell
http://localhost:3000/api/v1/users
```

**API request**

```shell
curl --location 'localhost:3000/api/v1/users' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxLCJleHAiOjE3NTM3NjcwNzR9.JGNtk8hB2zSDBU05HtDw2BR0__6WHv7D5QFJjV1I4l0'

}
```

### Create a User (User/Admin Ability Required)

Make an `HTTP POST` request to the following route to create a other role (admin/editor/manager etc.) user. You must include a Bearer token obtained from User/Admin authentication. A bearer admin token can create other user.

```shell
http://localhost:8000/api/v1/users
```

For example, to update the user with id 2, use this endpoint `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/users/2`

**API request**

```shell
curl --location --request POST 'localhost:3000/api/v1/users' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoyLCJleHAiOjE3NTM3NjcwNzR9.MMFIA1OwwXkPpkmaEZbz4P6fGvKJ28Uy8PTsL6RgBa8' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "user": {
        "name": "Sanda admin 1",
        "email": "admin1@sanda.project",
        "password": "sanda-admin-123",
        "role": "admin"
    }
}'
```


**API Payload**

You can include `name` , `email`, and `role` in a JSON payload, just like this

```json
{
  "user": {
    "name": "Sanda Another Admin",
    "email": "another-admin@sanda.project",
    "password": "sanda-admin-123",
    "role": "admin"
  }
}
```
**API Response**

You will receive the created user if the bearer token is valid.

```json
{
  "status": 201,
  "message": "Successfully data created",
  "data": {
    "id": 4,
    "name": "Admin",
    "email": "admin3@oytrack.project",
    "role": "admin",
    "created_at": "2025-08-06T07:55:48.536Z",
    "updated_at": "2025-08-06T07:55:48.536Z",
    "deleted_at": null
  }
}
```

For any unsuccessful attempt with an invalid token, you will receive a 401 error response.

```json
{
  "status": 401,
  "message": "Invalid token",
  "data": null
}
```

If a bearer user token attempts to update any other user but itself, a 401 error response will be delivered

```json
{
  "status": 401,
  "message": "unauthorized",
  "data": null
}
```

If role is invalid, then you will get a 500 error response like below:

```json
{
    "status": 500,
    "message": "'editor' is not a valid role",
    "data": null
}
```

### Update a User (User/Admin Ability Required)

Make an `HTTP PUT` request to the following route to update an existing user. Replace {userId} with actual user id. You must include a Bearer token obtained from User/Admin authentication. A bearer admin token can update any user. A bearer user token can only update only his/her information.

```shell
http://localhost:8000/api/v1/users/{userId}
```

For example, to update the user with id 2, use this endpoint `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/users/2`

**API request**

```shell
curl --location --request PATCH 'localhost:3000/api/v1/users/2' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoyLCJleHAiOjE3NTM3NjcwNzR9.MMFIA1OwwXkPpkmaEZbz4P6fGvKJ28Uy8PTsL6RgBa8' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "user": {
        "name": "Sanda User 1",
        "email": "user@sanda.project"
    }
}'
```


**API Payload**

You can include `name` or `email`, or both in a JSON payload, just like this

```json
{
  "user": {
    "name": "Sanda User 1",
    "email": "user@sanda.project"
  }
}
```
**API Response**

You will receive the updated user if the bearer token is valid.

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "message": "Successfully data updated",
  "data": {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Sanda User 1",
    "email": "user@sanda.project",
    "role": "user",
    "created_at": "2025-07-28T05:30:33.853Z",
    "updated_at": "2025-07-28T05:30:33.853Z",
    "deleted_at": null
  }
}
```

For any unsuccessful attempt with an invalid token, you will receive a 401 error response.

```json
{
  "status": 401,
  "message": "Invalid token",
  "data": null
}
```

If a bearer user token attempts to update any other user but itself, a 401 error response will be delivered

```json
{
  "status": 401,
  "message": "unauthorized",
  "data": null
}
```

### Delete a User (Admin Ability Required)

To delete an existing user, make a `HTTP DELETE` request to the following route. Replace {userId} with actual user id

```shell
http://localhost:3000/api/v1/users/{userId}
```

For example to delete the user with id 2, use this endpoint `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/users/2`

**API Request**

```shell
curl --location --request DELETE 'localhost:3000/api/v1/users/2' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxLCJleHAiOjE3NTM3NjcwNzR9.JGNtk8hB2zSDBU05HtDw2BR0__6WHv7D5QFJjV1I4l0'
```

**API Payload**

No payload is required for this call.

If the request is successful and the bearer token is valid, you will receive a JSON response like this

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "message": "Successfully data deleted",
  "data": null
}
```

You will receive a 401 error response for any unsuccessful attempt with an invalid token.

```json
{
  "status": 401,
  "message": "Invalid token",
  "data": null
}
```

For any unsuccessful attempt with an invalid `user id`, you will receive a 404 not found error response. For example, you will receive the following response when you try to delete a non-existing user with id 16.

```json
{
  "status": 404,
  "message": "Couldn't find User with 'id'=20",
  "data": null
}
```

## Notes

### API Gateway Key Verification

Sanda supports API Gateway key verification. When enabled, all requests must include a valid key in the `x-api-gateway-key` header.

To enable this, set the `API_GATEWAY_KEY` environment variable in your `.env` file:

```env
API_GATEWAY_KEY=your-secure-gateway-key
```

If this variable is set, any request without the matching header will receive a `403 Forbidden` response.

### API Payload Encryption

For enhanced security, Sanda supports End-to-End (E2E) API payload encryption using **AES-256-GCM**.

#### How it works:
1. **Request Encryption**: When enabled, the server expects incoming POST/PATCH/PUT payloads to be encrypted.
2. **Response Encryption**: The server automatically encrypts all JSON responses.
3. **Decryption**: The server decrypts the payload before processing and encrypts the response before sending it back.

#### Configuration:
Set the following environment variables in your `.env` file:

```env
API_PAYLOAD_ENCRYPTION_ENABLED=true
API_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-64-character-hex-key
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `API_ENCRYPTION_KEY` must be a 64-character hex string (32 bytes). If a shorter string is provided, it will be padded to 32 bytes automatically.

#### Payload Structure:
The encrypted payload should be a Base64 encoded string of:
`IV (12 bytes) + Ciphertext + AuthTag (16 bytes)`

When sending an encrypted request, you can wrap it in a JSON object:
```json
{
  "payload": "BASE64_ENCRYPTED_STRING"
}
```
Or send the raw encrypted Base64 string directly.

### Default Admin Username and Password

When you run the database seeders, a default admin user is created with the username **admin@sanda.project** and the password **sanda-admin-123**. You can login as this default admin user and use the bearer token on next API calls where admin ability is required.

When you push your application to production, please remember to change this user's password, email or simply create a new admin user and delete the default one.

### Default Role for New Users

The `user` role is assigned to them when a new user is created. 

There are two default role in Sanda.

| Role Slug   | Role Name   | Rank |
|-------------|-------------|------|
| admin       | Admin       | 0    |
| user        | User        | 1    |  

This Role variables is configured in `config/roles.yml`. If you want to add more role, open `config/roles.yml` file and add your role in below the user role with rank. 
Suppose, you want to add a new role named `editor`. then, it will like below:

```yaml
# config/roles.yml
admin: 0
user: 1
```


### Single Session or Multiple Session

Sanda doesn't invalidate the previously issued access tokens when a user authenticates. So, all access tokens, including the newly created one, will remain valid.

### Add `Accept: application/json` Header In Your API Calls (Important)

This is very important. To properly receive JSON responses, add the following header to your API requests.

```shell
Accept: application/json
```

For example, if you are using `curl` you can make a call like this.

```shell
curl --location 'localhost:3000/api/v1/users/1' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoyLCJleHAiOjE3NTM3NjcwNzR9.MMFIA1OwwXkPpkmaEZbz4P6fGvKJ28Uy8PTsL6RgBa8' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

### Logging

Sanda comes with an excellent logger to log request headers, parameters and response to help debugging and inspecting API calls. Check log details into log folder.

### Code Formatting

Sanda comes with an excellent code formatter called [Rubocop](https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop) out of the box, with an excellent configuration preset.

To format your code using `rubocop`, you can run the following command any time from inside your project diretory.

```shell
bundle exec rubocop -a
```

### RSpec Testing

Sanda comes with 100% test coverage using RSpec. You can check testing following command:

```shell
bundle exec rspec
```

To check coverage, open the coverage file:

```shell
open coverage/index.html
```

## Tutorial

So you decided to give Sanda a try and create a new protected API endpoint; that's awesome; let's dive in.

### Create a New API Controller

You can create a normal or a resourceful controller. To keep it simple, I am going with a standard controller.

```shell
rails generate controller API::V1::BlogsController
```
This will create a new controller file called `app/controlers/api/v1/blogs_controller.rb`

### Add a Function

We will add `index` function that will return `Hello Sanda` text.

Open this file `app/controlers/api/v1/blogs_controller.rb` and add the following code

```ruby
class Api::V1::BlogsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    data = "Hello Sanda"
    render_json_response(:ok, I18n.t("data.success.fetched"), data)
  end
end

```

### Create Protected Routes

Let's create a protected route `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/blogs` to use this API

Open your `config/routes` file and add the following line at the end.

```ruby
namespace :api do
  namespace :v1 do
    get "blogs/index", to: "blogs#index"
  end
end
```


Now, blog controller file `app/controlers/api/v1/blogs_controller.rb` looks like below:

```ruby
class Api::V1::BlogsController < ApplicationController
  before_action :authorization_request

  def index
    data = "Hello Sanda"
    render_json_response(:ok, I18n.t("data.success.fetched"), data)
  end

  private

  def authorization_request
    authorize @current_user, policy_class: BlogPolicy
  end
end
```

Nice! Now we have a route `/api/v1/blogs` that is only accessible with a valid bearer token.

### Test Protected Routes

If you have already created a user, you need his accessToken first. You can use the admin user or create a new user and then log in and note their bearer token. To create or authenticate a user, check the documentation in the beginning.

To create a new user, you can place a curl request or use tools like Postman, Insomnia or HTTPie. Here is a quick example using curl.

```shell
curl --location 'http://localhost:3000/api/v1/blogs' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjozLCJleHAiOjE3NTM3NzE1NDJ9.5ncIDT8oo0uEhBOwJLaIYjPCcnV4cMCCsMeICMVI8t0' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

Great! Now we have our users. Let's login as this new user using curl (You can use tools like Postman, Insomnia, or HTTPie)

```shell
curl --location 'localhost:3000/api/v1/registration' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "user": {
        "name": "Sanda User ",
        "email": "user2@sanda.project",
        "password": "sanda-user-123"
    }
}'
```

Now you have this user's accessToken in the response, as shown below. Note it.

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "message": "Successfully data fetched",
  "data": {
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo0LCJleHAiOjE3NTM3NzUyMjh9.jq_eTPEVJ8OjIY6OGvezPPRlyh4IITENvoaEHTWjfBU"
  }
}
```

The bearer token for this user is `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo0LCJleHAiOjE3NTM3NzUyMjh9.jq_eTPEVJ8OjIY6OGvezPPRlyh4IITENvoaEHTWjfBU`

Now let's test our protected route. Add this bearer token in your PostMan/Insomnia/HTTPie or Curl call and make a `HTTP GET` request to our newly created protected route `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/blogs`. Here's an example call with curl

```shell
curl --location 'http://localhost:3000/api/v1/blogs' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo0LCJleHAiOjE3NTM3NzUyMjh9.jq_eTPEVJ8OjIY6OGvezPPRlyh4IITENvoaEHTWjfBU' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

The response will be something like this.

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "message": "Successfully data fetched",
  "data": "Hello Sanda"
}
```

Great! you have learned how to create your protected API endpoint using Ruby on Rails and Sanda!

### Generate API Documentation

To generate API documentation, you can use the following command:

```shell
bundle exec bin/swagg
```

Now you know everything to start creating your next big API project with Ruby on Rails our powerful boilerplate project called Sanda Gateway. Enjoy!
